## **S**o **I** **F**ound **T**hat...

... my mouse wheel was getting dirty. The mouse in question is a Logitech G604 Lightspeed and it's a solid piece of construction that I've used for ~3 years. It's topped with a metal wheel that, 2 years into its life, has started to corrode and I've got NO CLUE WHY. No one in any forum has shared stories or pics of their mouse wheel going through the four of the five stages of decomposition.

On the flipside, people have previously discussed replacing the G604 mouse wheel. Apparently, this model's wheel tends to have more than a couple of issues. Filled with blinded confidence, I decided to give a home repair a shot--either I fix my mouse or I rummage my closet for an old one. Thus marked a two month long side project that was supposed to last two days

Unsurprisingly, Logitech has made dozens of mice over the years, constantly changing internal components, and providing no replacement parts or guides on repair. Fortunately, a slew of people have tread the same path I have and even recorded their disassembly. Lucky me!! and a huge appreciation for those few contributors that help countless people in the future, but we'll get back to that point later.

Eagerly and all-too-confidently, with my trusty precision screwdriver set and crude containers made of used gift card boxes, I set to work.

When the mouse wheel is depressed to middle click, the springs help to push the wheel back up. I looked down and was horrified to see a single spring where there were supposed to be two.

I still made the vain attempt to search for the missing spring, but no luck. With a carpeted room, it's a needle in a haystack. I looked up
