## Howdy!

My name is Crispy and this is my personal site, SIFTcast.

**SIFT** stands for **S**o **I** **F**ound **T**his... but what does it mean?

I stumble across factoids & tidbits often but, occasionally, some explode into fascinating topics and obsessive rabbit holes. Feeling it selfish to keep them to myself, I wanted to carve out a space to share them with the world.

Thus, this website was born.

Also, at the time of writing this, numerous social media platforms are imploding, so I thought it wise to have my own homepage anyhow.
